# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for creating this project stems from the ligelong-learner mentality. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. By creating this study guide, I want to create a tool that will not only help me throughout the bootcamp journey, but also serve as a tool to help others who are starting their own journey. 

On this project, I built a simple web app that contains notes and serves as a study guide for the upcomming full stack engineering bootcamp. The prework study guide will help solve the biggest problem facing bootcamp students, information overload! 

I have leared much about the git flow, along with the basics of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
